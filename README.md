## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser that supports JavaScript.
-   A local web server to run the project (due to browser security policies with `file://` URLs). Python's built-in HTTP server is a great option.

### Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Start a local web server:**
    If you have Python 3 installed, you can run the following command from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    This will start a server, typically on `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Open the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. The application should now be running.

## üîß Firebase Configuration

The Firebase project configuration is already included in the `script.js` file. The application is connected to a live Firebase project (`mechanic-db779`) and requires no additional setup for the frontend to function.

```javascript
// Firebase configuration in script.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  // ... and other keys
};
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for deployment with **Firebase Hosting**.

1.  **Install the Firebase CLI:**
    If you don't have it installed, follow the official instructions to install the [Firebase Command Line Interface](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).

2.  **Login to Firebase:**
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```

3.  **Deploy the site:**
    Run the following command from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only hosting
    ```
    After the command completes, the Firebase CLI will provide you with the URL for your live site.
